            <div class="excited">
                <h4>HTML 5</h4>
                <p>HTML 5 and CSS are exciting to learn because they will allow me to control how a website looks and
                    it's fun to experiment with different elements of design. Learning how to put together a framework
                    with HTML and how to use CSS to style a page will be give me the freedom to be more creative. It's
                    been exciting to experiment with HTML and CSS to design the look of a web page. The process can
                    sometimes be frustrating, especially when something isn't working, but it's rewarding when you are
                    able to come up with a design you like and can put it on a web page.</p>
